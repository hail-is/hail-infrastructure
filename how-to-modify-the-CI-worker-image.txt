If you want to all the agents to use that image, click "Agents", then click
"Cloud", then click "Stop" for all the agents listed (this will actually
Terminate them). New images will start up. Although they are marked as started
in the CI, they take time to start; check the amazon console. Moreover, the
agent may need to upgrade its components, but TeamCity lists this state as
"disconnected", do not fear as long as the Agent log contain messages about
"Unpacking plugin".

To debug these agents, SSH to them using the same credentials and username as
used above.

The TeamCity Agent is installed at /home/ec2-user/BuildAgent.
